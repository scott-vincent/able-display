able_display runs on RasPi2 inside the ABLE black box with four 7-segment displays.
able_fr24 also runs on the Black Box and fetches data from FlightRadar24.
able_live runs on RasPi3b an fetches data from PilotAware.

able_display calls get_able_data.py to read data from two sources:
  It reads the data from /mem/fr24_data
  It uses Tailscale to read the data from file able-live:/mem/pilotaware_data

It relies on able_fr24 which runs on this host under service able_fr24. This writes the data file.
Note that able-live writes file /mem/pilotaware_data and makes it available via Tailscale.

Note that able_fr24 also writes file /mem/fr24_live_data and makes it available via Tailscale so it
can be read by able-live.
