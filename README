able_display runs on RasPi2 inside the ABLE black box with four 7-segment displays.

It calls get_able_data.py to read data from two sources:
  It reads the data from /dev/shm/fr24_data
  It uses Tailscale to read the data from file able-live:/dev/shm/pilotaware_data

It relies on able_fr24 which runs on this host under service able_fr24. This writes the data file.
